# Gobrol Lambda

## ⚠️ WIP ⚠️

Serverless live chat application back-end using AWS Lambda, Websocket Gateway, and DynamoDB. Leveraged [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to provision the infrastructure.

## Getting Started

1. Unless you develop in devcontainer, you need to install the [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) CLI on your local machine for running the tasks. You also need to install [Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) and [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) on your local machine, then configure your AWS credentials. Refer to the [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/aws-build) for setting up your AWS credentials.

2. Run `task` to download the dependencies and build the project.
